# Lung Cancer Likelihood Predictor
- Created a Machine Learning model that classifies the likelihood of having lung cancer._
- Collected data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/cancer-patients-and-air-pollution-a-new-link), did Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Though it don't had that much imbalance, i used **<span title="Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique">SMOTE</span>** to balance the dataset
- Optimized __Logistic Regression, SVC, BaggingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier__ using __GridSearchCV__ to reach the best model.
